This tool is designed to make changing the grub configuration much easier

--clean

	Remove:
		-Memtest options
		-Ubuntu Advanced Menu
	Kept(all others, by default):
		-Ubuntu
		-Other OS's on computer

--restore

	will restore the grub.d (and therefore grub.cfg) to the way it looked when grubcfg was installed

	will save current configuration as <filename> in /etc/grubcfg/backups

--load <filename>

	will load a previously saved configuration located in /etc/grubcfg/backup/<filename>
